This project is composed of several sub-projects:

1. "map_scrape_main": Scrape the map provided by https://www.literature-map.com/

    Starting from "Haruki Murakami" and iteratively add sites to be inspected to the queue
    (use n workers), save the site and its observable neighbors

2. "cluster_analysis": Once the map (or snapshot) is ready, get your cluster of writers
    - /log/p1, ~4000 writers

    J.K.Rowling, Ted Chiang are in P0, along with the authors of your mass market books from the lot sale. Suppose that
    P0 contains best seller writers advertised by US newspapers / Walmart sales... ( such a filter bubble!

3. Once the cluster is achieved, go to goodreads for the user ratings, DOB/Birth Place, genres, select top 10% of the cluster of writers as
    the writers of interest  (keep the rest for backup info)

    pending: something wrong with the result saving


4. Once the list of authors is achieved, go to wiki for the authors' information (currently, get the info cards only)

    got 2000/~4000



Finally, Collect these information and put them in a tsv file, and then in chunks of spreadsheet - grouped by nationalities/DOB
for further use.
